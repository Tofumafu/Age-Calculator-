Age Calculator Description:
The Age Calculator is a simple and interactive tool designed to calculate a user's exact age based on their inputted date of birth. By entering the year, month, and day of birth, the calculator instantly determines the user's age in years, months, and days. This project is a great example of how to handle user input, perform date calculations, and present the results in a clear and user-friendly way. It can also help you practice working with JavaScript's Date object, string-to-number conversions, and layout alignment with HTML and CSS.

Key Features:
- Accepts user input for the year, month, and day of birth.
- Outputs the age in years, months, and days.
